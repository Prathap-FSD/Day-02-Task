Title: Differences Between the Document and Window Objects


1. Document Object:

The Document object represents the web page itself, including all its content, such as text, images, forms, and other elements. It is often accessed through the `document` property in JavaScript. Here are some key characteristics of the Document object:

- **Access to HTML Elements**: The Document object allows you to access and manipulate HTML elements within the web page. You can find, modify, or delete elements by selecting them using methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `getElementsByClassName`.

- **Structure and Content Manipulation**: You can alter the structure and content of the web page using the Document object. You can create, modify, or remove elements and their attributes.

- **Event Handling**: Document objects are used for handling events that occur within the document, such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard inputs. You can add event listeners to elements to respond to user interactions.

- **DOM Tree**: The Document object represents the entire DOM tree structure, starting with the `<html>` element and branching down to all the child elements within the web page.

2. Window Object:

The Window object, on the other hand, represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded. It is often accessed through the `window` property in JavaScript. Here are some key characteristics of the Window object:

- **Global Scope**: The Window object is at the top of the scope chain and is global, meaning that properties and functions defined on the Window object are accessible from anywhere in your JavaScript code.

- **Browser Interaction**: It provides control over the browser itself. You can use the Window object to manipulate browser features, such as opening new windows or tabs, resizing windows, and navigating to different URLs.

- **Timers and Intervals**: The Window object allows you to create timers and intervals for executing code at specified intervals. Functions like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are part of the Window object.

- **Global Variables**: Variables declared without the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords become global variables and are attached to the Window object.

- **Location and History**: It provides access to the browser's location (URL) and history, allowing you to navigate the user to different pages or check the current page's URL.

Key Differences:

Now that we've discussed the Document and Window objects separately, let's summarize the key differences between them:

1. **Purpose**: The Document object represents the web page's content, allowing you to manipulate HTML elements, while the Window object represents the browser window itself, providing control over browser features.

2. **Scope**: The Document object is limited to the current web page, while the Window object is global and accessible throughout the entire JavaScript environment.

3. **Content vs. Browser Control**: The Document object deals with the content and structure of the web page, while the Window object deals with browser-specific functions and interactions.

4. **Event Handling**: The Document object is used for handling events within the web page, while the Window object is used for browser events and interactions.
